# Day 1's Reflection
I met my team and our instructor, looking forward to learn from this training enough to make me begin path to learn ML and continue my career shift. Dr Taniya is such a great person and a high achiever. I felt this is the right place to start learning when I saw everybody from everywhere are gathered for the same goal I want. I also like to get to know my team better.
# Day 2's Reflection
Well I was kinda confused at first but I managed to pick up many things and learned a lot from the attached links and tutorials so everything is alright so far.
# Day 2's Q&As
Q. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
A. In supervised ML the machine is trained on predefined set of datasets to be trained and be able to reach a conclusion when the machine is given new data. In unsupervised ML well you just have a pile of data without previous training or predefined datasets and the machine is set to find or discover patterns between data.

Q. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
A. The statement is completely false since Scikit-Learn is built on these libraries and it uses NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, IPython, Sympy and Pandas.
